Instead of dereferencing the pointer and displaying 10 consecutive items at that memory address, the debugger tries to who you 10 items starting at the address of the pointer variable on the stack. \r\n\r\nThis image shows examining a pointer on the stack:\r\n!http://faculty.chemeketa.edu/ascholer/temp/Capture1.PNG!\r\n\r\nNote that the pointer holds the address 0xc912a0 and is located at 0x0029feac. Then I try do display as Array of 10 items and get:\r\n!http://faculty.chemeketa.edu/ascholer/temp/Capture2.PNG!\r\n\r\nThe base address of it is displaying is 0x0029feac and the first value it is displaying is the address 0xc912a0 displayed as a decimal 13177504.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
