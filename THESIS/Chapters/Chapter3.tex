General approaches:

\begin{itemize}
\item VECTOR-SPACE APPROACH: NLP preprocessing of data + customized vector based method (combining TFIDF) + optimization process [2][4]
\item ALIGNMENT APPROACH: NLP preprocessing of data + lexical \& syntactic basic module score + average score against threshold [3][5]
\item MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH: NLP preprocessing of data + Feature Extraction process (lexical \& syntactic) + ML classification (supervised) [1][6][8][10]
\end{itemize}
